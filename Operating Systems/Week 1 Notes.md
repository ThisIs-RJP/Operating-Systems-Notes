# What is an Operating System
- -> A program that <u>acts as an intermediary</u> between a user of a computer and the computer hardware
- -> OS goals
	- Execute user programs + make solving user problems easier
	- Make the computer system easier to use
	- Use the computer hardware in an efficient matter
- *"The one program running at all times on the computer"* is called the <u>kernel</u>, which is part of the operating system
- Everything else is either
	- A <u>system program</u> (ships with the operating system, but not part of the kernel), or
	- An <u>application program</u>, all programs not associated with the operating system
# Computer System Structure
- Computer system can be divided into <u>four components</u>
	- ***Hardware*** - provides basic computing resources
		- **Example:** CPU, memory, I/O devices
	- ***Operating System***
		- -> Controls + coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users
	- ***Application Programs*** - Defines the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing problems of the users
		-  **Example:** Word processors, compilers, web browser
	- ***Users*** 
		- **Example:** People, machines, other computers

# Some major/common operating systems
- -> Microsoft Windows
- -> POSIX Compliant (or mostly compliant) operating systems
	- **Linux**: MX Linux, EndeavorOS, Manjaro, Mint, Ubuntu...
	- **BSDs:** FreeBSD, NetBSD, Darwin...
- -> Some are proprietary (Windows), some are not (Linux, BSD), some are for embedded devices (QNX, VxWorks, WinCE)

### Note that some operating systems have different goals and and different supported platforms
# Real-Time Embedded Systems
- -> Real-time embedded systems most prevalent form of computers
